The TensorFlow implementation of the liver fibrosis classification.
===
The key idea of the proposed framework is to exploit the local consistency attention mechanism to optimize the feature from the pyramid structure, 
obtaining the robust feature representation for the liver fibrosis classification task.

#The code is on the basis of the VGG16.
#The code is written for Python 3.6 with tensorflow 1.9.0
